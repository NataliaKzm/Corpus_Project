This part is dedicated to a corpus analysis that was conducted with a help of [**Natural Language Toolkit(NLTK)**](https://www.nltk.org/install.html)
One can find here several methods for the corpus analysis e.g. frequency of use of words within the corpus after stemming and removal of stopwords etc.  

The sequential order of scripts represented here is the following:
1. NLTK_basic.py
2. Frequency_distributions.py 
3. Stemming_lemmatization.py
